                Paul Charles Caravello (July 12, 19 50 – November 24, 1991), 
                better known by his stage name Eric Carr, was an American 
                musician and multi-instrumentalist who was the drummer for 
                the rock band Kiss from 1980 to 1991. Caravello was selected 
                as the new Kiss drummer after Peter Criss departed, when he 
                chose the stage name "Eric Carr" and took up The Fox persona. 
                He remained a member of Kiss until his death from heart cancer 
                on November 24, 1991, at the age of 41.

                Carr was of Italian descent. He grew up in the Brownsville 
                section of Brooklyn in New York City. Because his father worked 
                most of the time, Carr didn't see that much of him, and "never 
                went to a baseball game or that kind of stuff" with his father. 
                He spent a lot of time alone in his room, playing with toy soldiers 
                and toy monsters. br
                While still in high school, Caravello began playing with a string 
                of bands mostly performing covers of Top 40 songs. As he described 
                it later, "Top-40 in those days was everything – funk, ballads, 
                rock, country, and everything. It was a great time for radio." 
                His first band, The Cellarmen, was formed in 1965 by him and several 
                of his friends. They started playing local clubs in Brooklyn and 
                Queens. Only a handful of recordings were released on the Jody Records 
                label, a small Brooklyn recording studio. Caravello then joined a band 
                called "Things That Go Bump in the Night" and later "Smack", 
                the latter of which consisted mostly of members from The Cellarmen, 
                who disbanded in 1968.

                Caravello applied for Kiss, submitting a cassette tape of Kiss' current 
                single "Shandi" but with his vocals over the music instead of Paul Stanley's 
                vocals. "It sounded great!" he enthused years later. The application was 
                put into a bright orange folder to make it stand out visually. Jane Grod, 
                a Kiss staffer, told him later she had noticed the brightly colored envelope 
                and so picked it to be one reviewed from the pile.
                For his Kiss persona, Carr initially tried "The Hawk"; this concept was 
                apparently very difficult to realize in greasepaint – a suitable make-up 
                design was never created, and the "Hawk" costume was a "bright orange yellow!" 
                The idea was dropped after Paul Stanley mentioned that it looked like Big Bird. 
                With the band on deadline (only two weeks before Carr's stage debut), Carr 
                came up with the make-up design for the persona of "The Fox"; Simmons liked it 
                and thus the character was born. The original design was modified within days 
                of Carr's initial photo sessions and debut concert as a KISS member.

                In February 1991, Carr began feeling ill. Medical tests initially revealed 
                what appeared to be manageable health issues.However, further tests determined 
                that he had heart cancer. In April 1991, Carr underwent a series of surgeries 
                to remove tumors in his right atrium and lungs in an effort to restore heart 
                function and prevent the cancer's growth. Soon after Carr's diagnosis, 
                Paul Stanley and Gene Simmons replaced him with session drummer Eric Singer 
                to commence new recordings for the band's upcoming album Revenge.
                Carr's last public appearance with Kiss was at the MTV Video Music Awards in 
                September 1991. Not long afterwards, he suffered an aneurysm and was rushed 
                to the hospital. Several days later, he suffered a brain hemorrhage and never 
                regained consciousness. On November 24, 1991, Carr died at the age of 41. 
                He died on the same day as Freddie Mercury, the lead singer of the British 
                rock band Queen, whose death attracted more media attention. Carr had also been 
                in a nearly four-year relationship with future model/actress Carrie Stevens at 
                the time of his death.
